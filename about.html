				<h3 class="titles_dark">I am Elli</h3>


				<p class="description_dark"> I graduated from the Faculty of Business Administration and tried to build my 						life in this direction. At the same time, I can also say that I am a bartender. Throughout my education 					years, I had many chances to work and learn in this field. In fact, by combining these two areas it is 						possible to create interesting ideas and activities. In the <a href="casestady.html">Case Studies</a> 						section, you can see some case analyses related to this.
				</p>

				<p class="description_dark">During my bachelor studies, I worked as a stakeholder analyst, trainer, and 						business consultant. Right after graduation, I moved to Germany and started a master’s degree here, but I 					had to pause it. Because of bureaucratic reasons, more precisely limited work permission, I worked for 						several years as a worker in agriculture. In the last year, I returned to bartending to continue my life. 					At the same time, I completed a one-semester Postgraduate Study program in Business Intelligence.
				</p>



				<h5 class="subtitle_dark">My personal view on business</h5>


				<p class="description_dark"> This can be explained with two main factors. The first one, if we use an older 						term, is a liberal approach. In modern terminology, we can call it an agile approach. The second factor 					is the importance of decisions based on data and details. Because of this second factor, I chose my last 					specialization in this field. My final research project in that program also focused on the topic of 						agile approach.
				</p>

				<p class="description_dark"> A non-conservative approach helps us make freer and more comfortable decisions 						in all business processes. In the end, any business is like creating a simulation that did not exist 						before. When we start from zero, we define all the processes and rules ourselves from how we produce to 					how we 	sell. If we only follow previously written theories, it would mean ignoring the simulation we are 					building, because every simulation has its own small and unique characteristics. General theories are 						very useful to open new perspectives and ideas. But they cannot replace real observation and 							adaptation. This way of thinking is not only for building a business from zero. It can also be applied in 					daily processes, in product or project management. As Ms. Nelli Weiß says, “product management is like 						managing a company inside a company.” I find this comparison very accurate. It shows that these ideas are 					not only valid when starting a business, but for all business processes. The modern agile approach 						touches this topic in a very strong way. In a world that is becoming more dynamic every day, fast 						decision-making, tolerance for change and openness to innovation are almost a necessity.
				</p>

				<p class="description_dark"> My sensitivity to metrics probably comes from my connection with mathematics. 						Decisions that are only intuitive and cannot be measured or tested are in my opinion a serious problem. 					Of course, I cannot ignore experience-based and implicit knowledge decisions. These exceptions exist, but 					they usually cover only a small part of the process. In most cases, decisions are shaped by existing 						metrics and their impact. Focusing on details and making decisions based on them does not only help us 						predict results. It also makes it much easier to go back, correct mistakes, and rebuild processes when 						something goes wrong.
				</p>
			
				<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Mathematical</h5>


				<p class="description_dark">This way of thinking about business is often called “mathematical”. Yes, I always try 					to have a mathematical way of thinking. I also find it interesting to think about mathematics itself. 						Personally, I believe that mathematics is not invented, but discovered. More precisely, the arguments for 					discovery seem stronger to me than the others. In business, however I cannot say that this approach is 						always the most successful one. For example. Once a friend said about the equation “0.(9) = 1”: “You see, 					even mathematics is not mathematical.” This is not an argument that can be ignored or rejected easily. He 					said this during a meeting of a project we were working on. I understand that there must be a balance, 						but I believe that mathematical thinking should have a very large place in this balance.
				</p>

				<p class="description_dark">When we touch the nature of mathematics itself, it becomes a bit existential. All 						situations, or more concretely all problems are like solving an equation. There is always an unknown, an 					“x” and when we correctly find what to put in its place, the problem is solved. Sometimes these 						equations are very complex, with many variables, or even quadratic equations. In the real world, they are 					almost infinite, like equations with infinite variables. There is no end to ideas and approaches to 						solving problems. To solve these equations, we always work with the elements we already know about the 						problem. For business processes, this is simply a daily way of living and thinking.
				</p>

				

				<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Mixology</h5>

				<p class="description_dark">When I talk about my bartending experience, I have had the chance to work as a 						bartender in three different countries and seven different cities, sometimes even for very short periods. 					This was truly an interesting and formative experience for me.The mixology side of this job is not only a 					profession for me, but also a hobby. Creating new flavors by combining different tastes is something I 						sincerely recommend to everyone who is reading this. I am constantly searching for new tastes. At first 					glance, this field may seem limited, but in reality the richness of flavors is much greater than we 						think. The number of possible combinations to discover is almost endless.

				</p>

				<p class="description_dark">
					The most interesting part here is personalization. You can create your own liqueur recipes and shape 						flavors that perfectly match your own taste. It is easier than it sounds.
				</p>
				
				<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Rock'n Roll</h5>

				<p class="description_dark">Rock’n’roll is one of the things that represents me, so I also want to touch on this 					topic. In the future, I plan to add a new section to this page. It will include performances that are 						truly amazing, but not very famous, mostly acoustic recordings. I want to collect them all on one page. 					For listening, I prefer rock’n’roll, alternative rock, and alternative music in general. A cappella or 						recordings made with only a few instruments feel much more powerful to me than highly produced studio 						works. Because of this, I also plan to share my discoveries here — works created with small budgets, few 					instruments, and minimal intervention.
