						<h1 class="titles_dark">Ac Oldun? / Food-Delivery</h1>

						<p class="description_dark">Ac Oldun was my first serious and real commercial project. The idea 							did not start from technology, but from a simple daily problem: office food fills your 								stomach, but it does not feel like home. Many offices had catering services, but they 								were missing the taste and warmth of home-cooked food.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">I built the idea around this problem not just delivering food to 								offices, but delivering the feeling of home. In the first stage, everything was very 								simple. The food was cooked at home, the number of clients was small, and most processes 							were done manually. This stage helped me understand one important thing: the problem was 							real and people truly cared about it.
						</p>	

					
						<p class="description_dark">With this concept, I joined the IdeyaQazandı 2018 national 									entrepreneurshipcompetition and reached the final stage. I presented the idea on stage, 							answered many questions and explained it as a real business. Reaching the final was a big 							motivation for me, but honestly, I did not receive investment. My stage presentation from 							IdeyaQazandı can be seen here:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2136795326337478							&rdid=JmoFWiUVxwE2vT5J" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/watch</a>									

						<p class="description_dark"> At first, this moment felt like a failure, but it became a strong 								learning experience. I understood that having a good idea is not enough. Execution, cost 							planning and clear explanation of risks are just as important.
						</p>
						

						<p class="description_dark">	
							After some time, I found an alternative investor and relaunched Ac Oldun with a more 								realistic approach. At this stage, the project was no longer romantic. It was about 								operations, logistics, customer expectations, costs, and daily decisions. The project 								became fully functional and achieved successful results in practice. For me, Ac Oldun was 							not just a startup. It was my first real school as a founder. I learned about product–								market fit, responsibility and the real results of wrong decisions. This experience 								strongly shaped how I think and work in later projects.
