						<h1 class="titles_dark">Communication Power Program - Julia Rupprecht</h1>

						<p class="description_dark">This two-day Communication Power program was organized by the Career 							Center of Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University, and the training was conducted by Julia 								Rupprecht, a communication and rhetoric coach in Germany. Julia has academic background 							in "Speech Communication and Rhetoric" and also has practical experience in the field of 							speech and language, and her main focus on helping people express their 									thoughts in a clearer, more effective and convincing way.
						</p>

						

						
						<p class="description_dark">The goal here is not just to choose words correctly, but to 								understand how a person is perceived through their voice, body language and behavior 								style. During the training, practical answers were sought to questions like why sometimes 							even correct ideas don't reach the other side in the communication process, why some 								people automatically attract attention when speaking, while others remain invisible even 							though they give the same message. During the program, the basic principles of rhetoric, 							building arguments and situation-appropriate communication strategies were worked on 								through real dialogues. Through various workshops and practical tasks, participants 								learned how manipulation techniques work, how to recognize such approaches and how to 								react against them. The especially emphasized point was that during communication, not 								only what to say, but when and in what form to say it is more effective.	
						</p>
		
						<p class="description_dark">The strongest side of this program is that theoretical knowledge was 							analyzed not in an abstract form, but on real situations that we can face in daily life, 							academic and professional environments. Thanks to role plays, mutual feedback and 								observations, the psychological side of the communication process started to become 								clearer. At the end of the two days, significant progress was felt not only on speaking 							techniques, but also on self-confidence, observation ability and conscious reaction 								skills.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark"> Julia's teaching style was open, sincere and at the same time 								structured. No mandatory "rhetoric rules" were memorized; on the contrary, the aim was to 							make each participant's own natural communication style stronger and more effective. In 							this respect, the Communication Power program remained in memory as a practical 								experience that brings communication skills to a more conscious and effective level in a 							short time.
