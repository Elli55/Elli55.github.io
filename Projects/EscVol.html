						<h2 class="titles_dark">ESC Volunteering – Sustainable Development Education Project</h2>

						<h3 class="subtitle_dark">MONOPATIA ALLILEGGIIS (Solidarity Tracks)/European Solidarity Corps
						</h3>

						<p class="description_dark">I am currently volunteering at the Solidarity Tracks organization, 								erates on the island of Lefkada in Greece. The main focus of the organization is 								sustainable development, economic and environmental awareness, and community-based social 							initiatives. The projects are built on active participation of local communities and aim 							to create behavioral change.My volunteering activity is carried out under the European 								Commission’s European Solidarity Corps (ESC) program. The ESC program aims to give young 							people international experience in social, economic, and environmental fields, to work on 							real problems and to create sustainable impact at the community level.	
						</p>


						<h3 class="subtitle_dark">Main Areas of the Project</h3>

						<p class="description_dark">The main goal of the project is not only to share information about 							sustainable development, but to create real behavioral change. For this reason, the 								activities focus more on practical application and participant-based formats rather than 							only theoretical explanation. Through edu-games and micro-learning sessions, we try to 								present complex ideas in a simpler and more understandable way. The aim is not just for 							people to listen, but to actively engage with the topic, ask questions, and think 								critically.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">At the same time, we work on awareness initiatives related to the 								circular economy. In this area, the focus is not only to explain the theoretical 								framework of the concept, but to connect it with daily life and the local context. One of 							the main goals is to encourage people to think more confidently about their decisions 								related to consumption, entrepreneurship, and idea development. Overall, our activities 							are not focused on passive information sharing, but on shaping thinking patterns and 								supporting small but meaningful behavioral changes. For me, this process is especially 								interesting because it creates an opportunity to combine social engagement with economic 							logic.
						</p>

						
						<h3 class="subtitle_dark">My Role and Contribution</h3>

						<p class="description_dark">I take part in planning and implementing workshops and training 								sessions. During the monthly sessions, I work both in organizational tasks and as a 								facilitator. Currently, my main focus is on a circular economy project that I am 								developing in its early stage. In this phase, I am working on:

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							

							<ul>
								<li>Building the structure of the project</li>

								<li>Identifying stakeholders within the local community</li>

								<li>Designing the awareness model</li>

								<li>Testing workshop prototypes</li>

							</ul>
						</div>

						<p class="description_dark">I am working on the conceptual phase of this initiative. The main 								objective of this initiative is to connect economic and business thinking with 									sustainability principles. By transforming the concept of circular economy into a 								practical and locally relevant format, I aim to contribute, even in a small way, to a 								change in thinking at the community level.

						<h3 class="subtitle_dark">Lefkada</h3>

						<p class="description_dark">Lefkada island is located in the Ionian Sea in Greece. It is one of 							the few Ionian islands connected to the mainland by a bridge. The island is known for 								famous beaches such as Porto Katsiki and Egremni, its high cliffs, and its turquoise sea. 							Lefkada Town is the administrative and cultural center of the island. Areas such as Nydri 							and Vasiliki are active regions for tourism and water sports.
