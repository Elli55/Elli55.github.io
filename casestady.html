						<h3 class="titles_dark">Wiskey Product Portfolio Optimization Case Study</h3>

						<p class="description_dark">When I first looked at the brand's overall performance over the past 							two years, what caught my attention was the complaints around the 18YO product and a 								19% revenue decline despite significant marketing spend. My initial instinct was that 								12YO was pulling demand away from 18YO, creating a false read on where the real problem 							was. Part of why I thought that: I had already looked at competitor data and most of 								them were leaning premium. That made me think the market itself was moving in that 								direction. But the further I got into the customer data, the clearer it became the								problem wasn't 12YO. The problem was 18YO itself and how it was being positioned. 								Customers weren't turning it down because it was expensive. They just couldn't see why it 							was worth more than the 12YO sitting right next to it on the shelf. That realization 								shifted the entire direction of my analysis. And the competitive data was actually 								pointing the same way: there was a real, unfilled gap in the everyday-use segment								exactly where 12YO sat. So instead of recommending a repositioning push for 18YO, I made 							the case for simplifying the portfolio. I reallocated €1.52M in marketing budget and 								projected a €125K revenue uplift in Year 1 without increasing total spend.
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Business Context</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">This is a case study I built for my portfolio, based on a 									hypothetical premium whisky brand. The dataset was constructed using AI, designed to 								reflect realistic market dynamics drawn from publicly available industry benchmarks. The 							brand operates in the premium single malt whisky market a space where competing on price 							alone doesn't get you far. Heritage, storytelling, and how clearly a product earns its 								place on the shelf matter just as much as the price tag. And there will always be 								customers willing to pay in this category. That's exactly why sales here depend so 								heavily on perception, not just on the product itself. The portfolio runs across three 								age expressions: 12YO (€65), 18YO (€145) and 21YO (€320) each theoretically targeting a 							different type of buyer. Looking at the competitive landscape, the picture is clear: 								Glenfiddich owns mass-premium, Macallan anchors ultra-luxury, Glenlivet holds accessible 							premium. Each of them knows exactly what it is. And that clarity is precisely what makes 							the problem sitting between 12YO and 18YO so visible and so urgent.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark"> What the competitive map makes clear is that the gap between mass-								premium and ultra-luxury isn't just about price it's about perception. Brands that hold 							that space successfully don't compete on cost. They compete on narrative. Trying to write 							a new narrative for 18YO would have been, frankly, a bit of a wishful move. But 12YO 								keeps the door open. Particularly through sustained B2B partnerships bars, cocktail 								venues, on-trade channels 12YO has a real shot at becoming the lead player in this 								portfolio.

						<p class="description_dark">This analysis highlights a clear gap between mass-premium and ultra-							luxury positioning, where differentiation relies less on price and more on perceived 								expertise, storytelling, and channel strategy.
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">The Problem Statement</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">Despite significant marketing investment (€1.52M in 2024), the 								portfolio began to show structural weaknesses that negatively impacted both revenue and 							brand perception:
						</p>
						
						

						<div class="ul-with-title"><ol>
							<li><p class="description_dark ul-li-title">2YO dominance created internal 												cannibalization:</p>

    								<p class="description_dark">With 660 units sold annually and the highest value-									for-money perception, 12YO increasingly attracted customers who would otherwise 								consider 18YO, weakening the mid-tier product’s role.
								</p></li>
				
							<li ><p class="description_dark ul-li-title">18YO suffered from unclear 										positioning:</p>

								<p class="description_dark">Positioned between volume-driven 12YO and prestige-									driven 21YO, 18YO lacked a distinct identity, resulting in a 19% year-over-year 								revenue decline and growing customer perception that it was “not worth the 									premium over 12YO.”
								</p></li>

							<li><p class="description_dark ul-li-title">21YO faced pressure to justify its 										premium price:</p>

								<p class="description_dark">While maintaining strong brand prestige, declining 									volumes (-11% YoY) indicated rising expectations from status-driven buyers and 									increased sensitivity to perceived value versus ultra-luxury competitors.
								</p></li>
						</ol></div>

							<figcaption class="description-text">Fig. 1: Competitive landscape by price point and 									brand positioning  mapping key players across the premium single malt whisky 									market (2024).
							</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p class="description_dark">The competitive landscape highlights that brand naturally attracts 								connoisseurs and flavor-driven customers through its craft and story-driven positioning. 							This creates an opportunity to target customers seeking depth and authenticity rather 								than mass accessibility. At the same time, competitors such as Glenfiddich benefit from 							aggressive marketing and broad distribution, allowing them to stabilize or even grow 								sales despite market pressure. Competing directly on mass retail or aggressive marketing 							would move our brand away from its core audience.  For status-oriented buyers, clear 								ultra-premium signaling is required, as they tend to anchor their perception around 								strong, easily recognizable luxury cues.

							<figcaption class="description-text">Fig. 2: Customer segmentation by purchase motivation 								and average annual spend four distinct groups identified across the premium 									whisky buyer base.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p class="description_dark">Customer segmentation reveals four clearly defined groups with 								distinct motivations and spending behavior. Connoisseurs show strong interest in 18YO, 								while Status Seekers gravitate toward 21YO and demonstrate the highest average annual 								spend. Powever, the data also indicates overlap between segments, particularly around 								premium expectations. While Connoisseurs value flavor exploration, their hesitation to 								commit to 18YO makes it difficult to fully convert interest into consistent purchases. 								Additionally, overall spending data suggests that Status Seekers spend more per location, 							which reduces the effectiveness of broad, location-based programs and increases the 								importance of precise product positioning.

							</figcaption>
						</figure>

											

						<p class="description_dark">Financial and sales performance data confirms that 18YO has 								experienced the sharpest decline across the portfolio. Despite relatively healthy 								margins, both revenue and unit sales have dropped significantly, indicating weakening 								willingness to pay rather than cost inefficiency. In contrast, 12YO remains highly 								resilient due to its strong value-for- money perception, while 21YO’s decline reflects 								rising expectations within a very specific and demanding customer group. This pattern 								supports the conclusion that 18YO’s challenges are primarily psychological and 									positional, rather than operational or market driven.

							<figcaption class="description-text">Fig. 4: Sales volume by distribution channel									breakdown across specialty stores, mass retail, duty-free and online for each 									age expression.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>


						<p class="description_dark">The distribution data shows that specialty stores play a 									disproportionately important role for 18YO and 21YO compared to mass retail channels. 								While retail supermarkets dominate 12YO sales, their impact on higher-age expressions is 							significantly lower. Given this structure, allocating additional resources to mass retail 							channels would not materially support premium objectives. Specialty stores are already 								aligned with the intended target audience and should remain the primary focus for premium 							portfolio execution. Other channels, such as duty-free and online partners, remain 								secondary and are currently too distant from the desired outcome to justify increased 								investment.

							<figcaption class="description-text">Fig. 5: Customer pain point analysis frequency and 								severity of key complaints by customer segment.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>


						<p class="description_dark">Customer pain points clearly indicate that the most critical issue 								centers around 18YO’s perceived value. The complaint “18YO not worth premium over 12YO” 							appears with high frequency and critical severity, particularly among Connoisseurs. This 							confirms that the challenge is not lack of interest, but a mismatch between price, 								expectations and communicated value. Additional concerns around brand perception and 								flavor variety further reinforce the need for clearer differentiation rather than 								increased promotional activity. These insights suggest that without addressing value 								perception, further investment in 18YO marketing would deliver diminishing returns.

							<figcaption class="description-text">Fig. 6: Marketing spend efficiency by channel ROI 									comparison and alignment with target customer segments (2024 actual).
							</figcaption>
						</figure>


						<p class="description_dark">Marketing spend analysis shows that a significant portion of 								investment is allocated to channels that primarily support 12YO volume rather than 								premium value creation. By discontinuing 18YO-focused campaigns, a substantial budget 								becomes available for reallocation. Redirecting part of this budget toward strengthening 							brand perception and premium signaling creates an opportunity to reinforce both 12YO and 							21YO without increasing total spend. In particular, reallocating funds from generic 								digital advertising toward more targeted channels improves alignment with premium 								objectives. Overall, this creates approximately €1.52M in available marketing capacity 								that can be used more strategically. 
						</p>
					
						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Proposed Marketing Reallocation</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">With 18YO marketing discontinued, approximately €1.52M becomes 								available for reallocation. Rather than increasing total spend, this budget will be 								redistributed to better support our simplified two-product portfolio.

							<figcaption class="description-text">Fig. 7: Product attribute scores by age expression 								perceived value, complexity, smoothness and brand aura rated against competitor 								average.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>


						<p class="description_dark">Product attribute scores reveal a clear imbalance in perceived value. 							While 18YO performs well on complexity and smoothness, its value-for-money score is 								significantly lower than both 12YO and the competitor average. This gap explains 								recurring customer dissatisfaction and reinforces price resistance. Without visual, 								experiential, or narrative upgrades, 18YO will continue to trigger friction at the point 							of purchase. Conversely, improving brand aura and visual perception around 12YO offers an 							opportunity to elevate perceived value without changing price.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Across all datasets, the evidence consistently points to a portfolio 							design issue rather than a demand shortage. The core challenge lies in how value is 								communicated and perceived across age expressions, with 18YO positioned in a way that 								creates friction instead of progression.
						</p>


						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Strategic Options:</h5>
						<br><br>

						<p class="titles_dark">Option 1: Aggressive Premium Repositioning of 18YO</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Strategy:</p>
					
						<p class="description-text">Reposition 18YO as a clearly premium product by increasing its price 							and limiting availability, aiming to close the perceived gap with 21YO.
						</p>
						

						

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Key Actions:</p>
				
						<ul>
							<li>Increase 18YO retail price to reinforce premium perception.</li>

							<li>Restrict distribution primarily to specialty stores.</li>

							<li>Shift messaging toward exclusivity and craftsmanship.</li>

							<li>Reduce mass-market visibility to avoid comparison with 12YO.</li>
						</ul></div>


						
						
						<p class="subtitle_dark">Expected Outcome: </p>
					
						<p class="description_dark">This approach could improve perceived value and margins if 									accepted by Connoisseurs, but carries a high risk of volume loss due to existins 								price sensitivity and weak value-for-money perception.
						</p>

		
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Risks:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Strong resistance from customers already questioning 18YO value.</li>

							<li>High probability of accelerated sales decline.</li>

							<li>Increased internal competition with 21YO.</li>
						</ul></div>



						<p class="titles_dark">Option 2: Portfolio Clarification by Phasing Out 18YO 											(Preferred)</p>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Strategy:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Remove 18YO from the active portfolio and simplify the value ladder 							by focusing on a clear two-step progression: 12YO for quality-driven volume and 21YO for 							status-driven premium demand.</p>

						
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Key Actions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Discontinue 18YO-focused marketing activities.</li>
	
							<li>Redirect freed marketing budget toward brand strengthening initiatives.</li>
	
							<li>Enhance visual identity and perceived value of 12YO.</li>
	
							<li>Reinforce ultra-premium signaling for 21YO through selective channels.</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Expected Outcome:</p>
				
						<p class="description_dark">By eliminating internal cannibalization and psychological friction, 							the portfolio becomes easier to understand. This strengthens trade-up logic toward 21YO 							while preserving 12YO’s strong volume base.
						</p>


						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Why This Option:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Directly addresses the most critical customer pain point.</li>
	
							<li>Frees approximately €1.52M in marketing capacity without increasing spend.</li>

							<li>Aligns with observed customer behavior and spending patterns.</li>

							<li>Reduces complexity and execution risk.</li>
						</ul></div>



						<p class="titles_dark">Option 3: Volume-First Strategy Focused on 12YO (Not Recommended)</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Strategy:</p>
					
						<p class="description_dark">Double down on 12YO as the primary growth driver by prioritizing 								volume and mass appeal while deprioritizing premium positioning.</p>



						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Key Actions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Allocate the majority of marketing spend to 12YO.</li>
	
							<li>Expand mass retail and promotional activities.</li>

							<li>Minimize focus on premium differentiation.</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Expected Outcome:</p>
						
						<p class="description_dark">Short-term sales stability driven by volume growth, but at the cost 							of long-term brand equity and premium perception.</p>

	

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Risks:</p>
		
						<ul>
							<li>Brand dilution and loss of premium identity.</li>
			
							<li>Reduced attractiveness for high-value customers.</li>
				
							<li>Increased price sensitivity across the portfolio.</li>
						</ul></div>

						<p class="description_dark">Given the structural nature of the problem and the risks associated 							with forcing premium repositioning, simplifying the portfolio emerged as the most 								sustainable and least risky strategic direction.
						</p>
						
						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Risk Analysis</h5>


						<p class="description_dark">While Option 2 offers the clearest path forward, it carries 									meaningful risks that require active management. Removing 18YO eliminates €15,950 								in annual revenue. Not all of this revenue will automatically transfer to other 							products.</p>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Downside Scenario:</p>
					

					
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">If customer behavior does not follow expectations, the following 								outcomes are possible:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>50% of current 18YO buyers move down to 12YO (55 customers)<br>
								Revenue gain: 55 × €65 = €3,575
							</li>

							<li>20% trade up to 21YO (22 customers)<br>
								Revenue gain: 22 × €320 = €7,040
							</li>

							<li>30% leave for competitors such as Glenfiddich or Macallan (33 customers)<br>
								Revenue lost: 33 × €145 = €4,785
							</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Net Impact:-€5,335 (-8% of total portfolio revenue)
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">This scenario becomes more likely if customers are not actively 								guided through the transition. To reduce this risk, a 90-day customer retention program 							will start in Month 1, including direct outreach to former 18YO	buyers and targeted 								incentives to encourage trial of 21YO. Removing 18YO creates a gap in the €145–200 price 							range, which competitors may see as an opportunity.
						</p>

					
						<p class="subtitle_dark">Likely Scenarios:</p>

						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Scenario 1:</p>
						
						<p class="description_dark">Glenfiddich reduces the price of their 18YO from €175 to €135. 								Position 12YO as better value ("Why pay €135 for 18 years when you can get quality at 								€65?") and accelerate brand elevation work to strengthen 12YO perception.
						</p>


						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Scenario 2:</p>
					
						<p class="description_dark">Macallan launches a new mid-tier product priced around €160. Double 							down on 21YO exclusivity and heritage positioning, where Macallan cannot fully match our 							craft story. Competitor pricing and product launches will be monitored monthly 									during the first six months, with flexibility to adjust strategy if market conditions 								change significantly.
						</p>


						<p class="description_dark"><strong>Retailer Relationship Risk</strong></p>

						<p class="description_dark">Specialty retailers currently generate revenue from three Balvenie 								products. Reducing the portfolio to two SKUs may reduce shelf presence and total sales 								for these partners.
						</p>

	
						<p class="subtitle_dark">Retailer Concern:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">"If Balvenie reduces my revenue, why should I give you premium shelf 							space?"</p>


						
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">To address this, a three-part specialty store partnership program 								will launch in Month 1:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Margin improvement — Increase 21YO retailer margin from 25% to 30%.<br>
								Cost: €512 per year, securing long-term relationships.
							</li>

							<li>Co-funded displays — €2,000 per store for premium in-store setups.<br>
								Total investment: €40K across 20 key locations.
							</li>
						
							<li>Staff training & events — Product education sessions and customer tasting events.<br>
								Total investment: €65K.
							</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="description_dark">This approach keeps retailers engaged and motivated to promote the 								remaining portfolio despite a reduced SKU count.
						</p>



						<p class="subtitle_dark">Customer Confusion Risk:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Some customers who actively searched for 18YO may feel confused or 								frustrated when it is no longer available.
						</p>

						

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">To manage the transition smoothly, the following steps will be 									taken:</p>


						<ul>
							<li>Month 1 — Inform specialty retailers first and provide clear talking points for 									staff.
							</li>

							<li>Month 2 — Email past 18YO buyers with a personal explanation and a one-time 15% 									discount on 21YO.
							</li>

							<li>Month 3–6 — Monitor customer service inquiries and retailer feedback on a weekly 									basis.
							</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="description_dark">If confusion or negative sentiment exceeds 20% of feedback, 								additional communication materials will be created or a limited farewell edition will be 							considered to ease the transition. These risks are real but manageable. Success depends 							on staying close to the data during the first six months and responding quickly if 								customer behavior deviates from projections.
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Recomendation</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">Based on the analysis, I recommend phasing out 18YO from active 								portfolio focus and simplifying the value ladder around two clearly differentiated 								products: 12YO as the quality-driven volume anchor and 21YO as the status-driven premium 							expression. This approach directly addresses the root causes identified in customer 								pains, financial performance, and marketing efficiency, while minimizing execution risk 							and preserving long-term brand equity.
						</p>


						
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">This recommendation was selected because it:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Eliminates internal cannibalization between 12YO and 18YO.</li>
	
							<li>Removes the most critical customer pain point around value perception.</li>

							<li>Frees marketing capacity without increasing total spend.</li>
	
							<li>Strengthens portfolio clarity and trade-up logic.</li>
	
							<li>Aligns with observed customer behavior rather than forcing repositioning.</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="description_dark">Implementation will follow a phased and controlled approach:</p>

						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Phase 1:  Portfolio Reset (Months 1–2)</p>

						<p class="description_dark">18YO-related marketing activities are discontinued. Existing 								inventory is managed through natural sell-through without promotional pressure.
						</p>


						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Phase 2:  Brand Reinforcement (Months 3–6)</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Freed marketing budget is redirected toward strengthening brand aura 							and visual perception, with a focus on modernizing 12YO communication and reinforcing 								premium cues around 21YO.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Phase 3: Premium Focus Optimization (Months 6–12)</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Selective channels such as specialty stores, trade shows, and 							targeted digital placements are used to support 21YO visibility and reinforce status-driven 							demand.
						</p>

						

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Success will be evaluated using the following metrics:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Stabilization of total portfolio revenue year-over-year.</li>

							<li>Reduction in customer complaints related to value perception.</li>
			
							<li>Improved marketing efficiency measured by ROI per channel.</li>

						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Primary Metrics (Business Impact):</p>

						<p class="ul-li-title">Total portfolio revenue: Maintain ≥ €69M per year.</p>

						<p class="description_dark">This case demonstrates how portfolio performance issues can stem not 							from market demand, but from internal complexity and unclear value communication. By 								prioritizing clarity over expansion, the strategy focuses on sustainable growth rather 								than short-term optimization.

						<h3 class="titles"> Method and Implementation Turnover Dashboard (Power BI)</h3>

						<p class="description_dark">The practical implementation of the first dashboard (Overview) aimed 							to make employee turnover visible while simultaneously integrating agile elements. The 								intention was to demonstrate how a functional HR dashboard can be developed with 								manageable effort. The process consisted of three parts: data preparation (ETL) in 								Python, the construction of a clear data model in Power BI, and the visualization of the 							most important key figures. In addition, I incorporated agile functions: a What-If 								parameter (“Target Attrition %”), the metric Gap-toTarget, a simple Risk Score, and a 								status card with warning indicators. As a result, the dashboard was iteratively extended 							and corresponds to the first sprint.						
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Data Preparation in Kaggle</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">As a data source,  I used an open HR dataset from Kaggle. This 								contained employee information such as age, income, department, or attrition status. In a 							Kaggle notebook, I performed basic data cleansing steps using Python (Pandas and NumPy).
						</p>

						<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/lrhmanelliverdiyev/turnover-seminararbeit-u-akademei" 								target="_blank">https://www.kaggle.com/code/lrhmanelliverdiyev/turnover-seminararbeit-u-							akademei
						</a>

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">This included:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Standardizing column names for easier further processing</li>

								<li>Converting relevant variables into categories</li>

								<li>Creating age, tenure, and income bands</li>

								<li>As well as creating flags, for example for attrition (0/1) and overtime (0/1)								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>


						<p class="description_dark">The result was a cleaned file hr_clean.csv, which served as the basis 							for Power BI. It is important to note that Kaggle was used exclusively for data 								cleansing, the visualization was carried out later in Power BI.
						</p>
		
						
						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">ETL Process (Practical Procedure)</h5>

						<p class="description_dark"> For my work, I prepared the HR data using a simple ETL process in 								Power BI. First, I imported the raw data from an Excel or CSV file into Power BI. Then I 							renamed the column names so that they were clear and consistent, for example “EmpID,” 								“Attrition,” or “OvertimeHours.” After that, I adjusted the data types, meaning whether 							they were numbers, text, or date values. In the next step, I cleaned the data. This means 							that I removed or corrected missing or incorrect values. Afterwards, I created new 								variables, for example a flag “Attrition = 1,” to clearly see which employees had left 								the company. In addition, I grouped certain attributes, for example salary classes or age 							groups. This makes the data easier to compare.
						</p>


						<p class="description_dark">The data model was also very important. For this purpose, I built a 							star schema that shows the connection between fact and dimension tables. Finally, I 								loaded the data into the model and was then able to create the visualizations and 								analyses in the dashboards.
						</p>

						
							
						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Data Model in Power BI</h5>
						

						<p class="description_dark">After importing the cleaned CSV file into Power BI, I built a star 								schema. The central fact table (Fact_HR) contains all employee data. In addition, I 								created dimension tables, for example Dim_Department, Dim_JobRole, Dim_AgeBand, 								Dim_TenureBand, and Dim_IncomeBand.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The relationships were created as (1: n). For the age and tenure 								bands, I inserted helper columns for sorting, whereby the order had to be adjusted 								manually in some visualizations. This approach makes the model clear and at the same time 							flexible. There is also a small table _Measures. It is deliberately created without 								relationships and serves only as a container for all DAX measures. The placeholder column 							is hidden; only the measures are visible in the report. This keeps the model clear and 								still flexible.
						</p>

						</figure>


						<h5 class="subtitle_dark"> Key Figures (DAX)</h5>

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title"> For the analysis, I calculated central key figures using DAX. 									These include:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Headcount = Total number of employees</li>

								<li>Attrition Count = Number of employees who have left</li>

								<li>Attrition Rate = Ratio of employees who have left to total employees</li>

								<li>Overtime Rate = Proportion of employees with overtime</li>

								<li>Avg Income = Average monthly income.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<p class="description_dark">These key figures enable both an overall overview and detailed 								analyses by departments, roles, or employee groups.
						</p>


						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Report Pages in Power BI</h5>

						<p class="description_dark"> Das Dashboard besteht aus drei Seiten.</p>
				
						<p class="description_dark">Overview: In addition to the central key figures (Headcount, 								Attrition Rate,	Overtime Rate, Avg Income), agile extensions were integrated. These 								include a What-If parameter for the attrition target, the key figure Gap-to-Target, a 								simple Risk Score, and a status card. In this way, turnover is not only described but 								also compared with target values and linked to risk indicators.
						</p>

						</figure>
	

						<p class="description_dark">Deep-Dive (Decomposition Tree): Here, the attrition rate could be 								broken down step by step according to various influencing factors (e.g., department, 								overtime, income, tenure). Slicers were deliberately reduced in order to keep the 								analysis freely exploratory.  In addition, two small KPIs (Attrition Rate and Gap-to-								Target) remained visible to that the target values were not lost. This clearly reflects 							the agile idea of interactive exploration.

						<p class="description_dark">Decision Support (Extended Drillthrough): The third page was expanded 							into an agile decision dashboard. In addition to detailed analyses per department, it 								contains three scenario buttons (Status Quo, Overtime-Cap, Onboarding-Boost) that 								simulate different situations. A recommendation card automatically provides suggestions 							(e.g., limit overtime, strengthen onboarding). A table shows the top 5 risk roles based 							on the new measure “Risk Score.” Demographic visualizations (age, tenure) immediately 								adapt to the selected scenario. This makes this page the clearest example of Agile BI.

						</figure>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Descriptive Results</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">The dashboard shows typical patterns of employee turnover that are 								also described in the literature. Younger employees (e.g., in the age band 18–25 years) 							and individuals with short organizational tenure (≤ 1 year) have a significantly higher 								exit rate. The risk likewise increases when overtime is regularly performed. Job roles in 							the Sales area are particularly affected.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">What was new here was that the results were not only visible 								descriptively but were also connected with agile elements. With the What-If parameter, a 							target value for turnover could be set, and the Gap-to-Target metric immediately showed 							the deviation between actual and target. The simple Risk Score combined factors such as 							overtime, tenure, and income, thereby making risk segments clearly recognizable. In this 							way, a purely descriptive analysis became an agile instrument that not only identifies 								patterns but also opens up scope for decision-making .

						<h3 class="titles_dark">Recruiting-Kanban & Experiment Dashboard (ATS Pipeline, Power BI)</h3>

						<p class="description_dark">The dashboard represents the recruiting process in Kanban logic. 								Important key figures such as Work-in-Process (WIP), Cycle Time, Throughput, Conversion, 							and Time-to-Hire change daily or weekly. Therefore, this case is well suited to make 								agile control visible. The report layout follows the ideas of IBCS/SUCCESS: a clear 								statement in the title, uniform colors, and a reduced design so that HR, IT, and hiring 							managers use a common data language
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Data Basis and ETL</h5>

						<p class="description_dark"> The solution uses three synthetic CSV files. ats_pipeline_events 								contains the event log per candidate and stage (Applied, Screen, Interview, Offer, 								Hired/Rejected) with stage_start_date and stage_end_date as well as contextual fields 								such as Department, Role, Seniority, Location, Source, Recruiter, and Variation (A/B). 								ats_candidates provides master data on the candidate (e.g., applied_date, recruiter, 								variation). ats_requisitions describes the vacancy (req_id, department, role, location, 							seniority). In Power BI, the files are imported, data types are set (especially the date 							fields), empty strings are treated as null, and identifiers are standardized. This event 							log is the appropriate foundation for Kanban because start and end timestamps per stage 							later directly enable calculations for CFD, Cycle Time, Aging, and Throughput.
						</p>

					
						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Data Model (Star Schema)</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">The model follows a star schema. The fact table ats_pipeline_events 							lies at the center. The dimensions ats_candidates, ats_requisitions, Dim_Date, and 								Dim_Stage provide the axes of analysis. Between Dim_Date[Date] and 										events[stage_start_date] there is an active 1:n relationship for “Flow-in.” Additionally, 							an inactive relationship from Dim_Date[Date] to events[stage_end_date] is stored. This  							inactive connection is deliberately activated in measures using USERELATIONSHIP() in 								order to correctly control “Flow-out” (e.g., hires per week). Attributes that appear 								twice in the fact table (e.g., department) are hidden in the report; for analyses, the 								columns from the dimensions are used. The model is lean and can easily be extended in 								sprints.

							<figcaption class="description-text"> Star diagram of the recruiting Kanban in 									Power BI (own representation, cf. GitHub 2025). </figcaption>
						</figure>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Dimensions and Sorting</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">Dim_Date is generated from the minimum of the start date and the 								maximum of the end date and is extended by Year, MonthNr, MonthText, and WeekNr. 								MonthText is sorted by MonthNr, and the table is marked as a date table. Dim_Stage 								defines the order of stages via stage_order (Applied … Rejected), so that diagrams sort 							consistently. These two tables ensure a clean time and process logic throughout the 								entire report.
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Key Figures and Analytical Logic (DAX)</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">The key figures combine descriptive transparency with simple 								prescriptive signals. Three central measures are presented as examples.Time-to-Hire 								(average in days) and Gap-to-Target.  First, the average duration between “Applied” and 							“Hired” is calculated. Afterwards, it is compared with a target value set via a What-If 							parameter.
						</p>

						<p class="code-text"> TTH := <br>
										VAR AppliedDate =<br>
										CALCULATE(<br>
										MIN(ats_pipeline_events[stage_start_date]),<br>
										ALLEXCEPT(ats_pipeline_events, 															ats_pipeline_events[candidate_id]),<br>

										ats_pipeline_events[stage] = "Applied")<br>
										VAR HiredDate :=<br>
										CALCULATE(<br>
										MAX(ats_pipeline_events[stage_end_date]),<br>

										RETURN<br>
										AVERAGEX(<br>
										VALUES(ats_pipeline_events[candidate_id]),<br>
										DATEDIFF(AppliedDate, HiredDate, DAY)<br>
										)<br>
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The target value is created as a What-If parameter TTH_Target; the 								gap results as Gap_TTH = [TTH] − [TTH_Target Value]. A positive gap indicates an SLA 								deviation and provides a clear impulse for action.
						</p>

			
						<p class="description_dark">WIP Limit and Over-Limit.  Kanban actively controls the number of 								parallel cases. WIP counts candidates in the active stages. With a second What-If 								parameter WIP_Limit, the limit is set; Over-Limit immediately signals bottlenecks.
						</p>

						<p class="code-text">WIP :=<br>
										CALCULATE(<br>
   										DISTINCTCOUNT(ats_pipeline_events[candidate_id]),<br>

										WIP_Over_Limit :=<br>
										VAR Over = [WIP] - [WIP_Limit Wert]<br>
										RETURN IF(Over > 0, Over, 0)<br>
							If Over-Limit > 0, overload is present. In practice, this leads to a measure, for example 							lowering the limit or increasing capacity.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark"> Throughput per Week (Flow-out).  For Hires and Rejections, the 								report counts cases by end date. For this purpose, the inactive date relationship is 								deliberately activated per measure.
						</p>

						<p class="code-text"> Hires_Woche :=<br>
										CALCULATE(<br>

						</p>

						<p class="description_dark"> The time series makes the outflow visible and shows whether the 								process delivers steadily or fluctuates. Together with the Screen-Interview conversion 								and the Cycle Time per stage, clear indications of bottlenecks emerge.
						</p>

					
						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Report Design and Visualization</h5>

						<p class="description_dark"> The first report page provides a compact overview: five KPI cards 									(Candidates, Hires, WIP, TTH, Gap_TTH) show status and target achievement. A 									gauge compares WIP with the limit and marks overload. The Cumulative Flow Diagram 								(stacked area chart) represents the flow across months; in-process stages are 									shown in shades of blue, Hired in green, Rejected in red. A SAY title names the 								core message, for example “TTH above target due to backlog in Screen 										(Engineering).”

						</figure>

						
						<p class="description_dark">The second report page serves root cause analysis. The Cycle Time per 							stage shows where most time is lost. A matrix with Department × Stage highlights the 								distribution of starts per stage; this count based on the start date is robust and 								responds cleanly to date filters. In addition, Hires_Week and Rejected_Week are displayed 							as lines to examine the outflow over the weeks.

						<p class="description_dark"> The third report page supports decisions through scenarios. What-If 							parameters (WIP_Limit, TTH_Target, optional Recruiter_Add) and bookmarks (Status Quo, 								Plus Recruiter, WIP Limit −20%, JD Text B) change the view with one click. The KPI cards, 							the gauge, and a small “Over-Limit” card respond immediately. Optionally, a simple rule 							can output a recommendation, for example: If Over-Limit > 0 and Cycle Time in “Screen” is 							high, then lower the limit or deploy +1 recruiter; if conversion is low, test variation 							B.

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Agile Value and Types of Analysis</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">The solution combines descriptive transparency with prescriptive 								indications. Descriptively, KPI cards, CFD, Cycle Time, and Throughput provide a clear 								picture of the current state and bottlenecks. Simple predictive indications arise from 								trends in Throughput and Conversion. Prescriptively, Gap-to-Target, WIP Limit, and the 								scenarios take effect: they directly lead to concrete measures within the process. 								Through the IBCS-oriented design, communication across departments remains consistent and 							understandable.

						<h3 class="titles_dark">Sylter Fisch Case Stasy</h3>

						<p class="description_dark">Our hero “Business Intelligence” today enables data-based decisions 							and adaptation to dynamic market conditions. This company has also recognized such a 								need, particularly in the area of assortment design and customer behavior. The increasing 							competitive pressure in retail as well as rising demands regarding assortment structure 							and customer orientation reinforce this necessity.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Modern markets are fast-moving, and as a result competition in retail 							has become very strong. For this reason, the logistics manager of “Sylter Fisch” has 								taken the initiative that a new BI system is required. After a requirements analysis with 							the IT department, management approved the project; however, they would like to see 								timely results. Sylter Fisch is a company known for its seafood products. They operate 								over 400 branches throughout Germany. They must organize their supply structure in such a 							way that every branch receives fresh products and controlling can maintain a clear rview.
						</p>

					
						<p class="description_dark"> Currently, the data is processed manually, which is very time-								consuming. For example, sales data is used without an automated system. The results of 								campaigns are hardly measurable. Competition between branches is difficult to analyze and 							lacks transparency. With the BI system, we will build a new system that clearly 								visualizes and automates sales analyses. Campaign results will be measured precisely, and 							new campaigns can be planned on a data-driven basis. The performance of branches will 								become comparable and overall performance will increase.	
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">In this case study, I will describe a BI prototype with which we can 							clearly analyze sales data, time trends, product activities, and campaign results. My 								main objective is to develop a new system in which decisions are made based on data
						</p>


						<h5 class="subtitle_dark"> Identification of the Operational Systems and Data Requirements</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">In this project, we use three operational sources: POS, ERP, and 								Marketing Excel. The objective is to provide complete sales information with revenue 								reference and to prepare it in such a way that later analyses in Power BI are clearly 								traceable (Time × Product × Branch × Campaign).
						</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">POS (Point of Sale)</p>
					
						<p class="description_dark">The cash register systems deliver all individual sales transactions. 							For analytics, we require at least the following fields:</p>

								<li>BranchID</li>

								<li>Date (in ISO format yyyy-mm-dd)</li>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">. Conception and Implementation of the Data Model</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">The operational systems from which the data for the BI project 								originate have now been described. On this basis, a model was developed that structures 							the information and prepares it for analysis in Power BI. The goal was to create a model 							that is easy to understand and at the same time represents all important connections 								between the data.
						</p>



						<p class="subtitle_dark">Basic Idea of the Model</p>

						<p class="description_dark">For the project, the star schema was chosen. This schema is clearly 							structured and well suited for BI applications because it enables fast queries and clear 							relationships. At the center stands a fact table in which the sales data are stored. It 							contains all key figures that are later used in analyses, for example the quantity sold, 							the unit price, the discount, and the calculated revenue.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Revenue was calculated according to the previously defined 									formula:<br>

							<em>Revenue = Quantity × Unit price × (1 − Discount / 100)</em>
						</p>

						<div class="ul-with-title">

							<p class="ul-li-title">Around the fact table, there are several dimension tables that 									contain additional information. These include:</p>					
							

							<ul>
								<li>Product dimension: Product name, category, and origin</li>

								<li>Branch dimension: Location, region, and size of the branch</li>
								
								<li>Time dimension: Date, month, year, and weekday.</li>

							</ul>
						</div>	
				
						<p class="description_dark">Through this structure, sales can be analyzed from different 								perspectives, for example by period, product, or location.</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Implementation of the Model</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">The model was first designed logically and then implemented 								technically. Each table has a unique key so that the relationships remain unambiguous. 								The connections follow the classic star pattern. A central fact table stands at the 								center and is connected to the three dimension tables via key values. In Power BI, these 							connections are automatically recognized once the files are imported.In the model view, 							this results in a clear star shape that shows the relationships between the tables.
						</p>
			
															
						<div class="ul-with-title">

							<p class="ul-li-title">A brief excerpt of the structure:</p>					
							

							<ul>
								<li>fact_sales - dim_product: Connection via ProductID</li>

								<li>fact_sales - dim_branch: Connection via BranchID</li>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Calculation and Use of Key Figures</h5>

						<p class="description_dark"> Revenue can either be stored directly in the database or calculated 							in Power BI. In this work, the second variant was used, as it is more flexible. The 								calculation was carried out in Power BI using a simple formula that is automatically 								executed for each row. As a result, the model remains dynamic: if prices or quantities 								change, the revenue value adjusts automatically.
						</p>
		
						<p class="description_dark">With this data model, the foundation for the subsequent ETL process 							has been created. The data are now structured in such a way that they can be cleaned, 								combined, and analyzed in Power BI in the next step.
						</p>

						

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">The ETL process is a central component of every business intelligence 							solution. It ensures that data from different sources are collected, cleaned, and 								prepared for analysis. At Sylter Fisch, the ETL process consists of three steps: 								extraction, transformation, and loading.
						</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Extract (Data Extraction)</p>

						<p class="description_dark"> In this step, the data are taken from the operational systems.
							At Sylter Fisch, they come from three sources. The POS system (sales), the ERP system 								(products and inventory data) and the Excel files from marketing (campaigns). All data 								are exported as CSV files because this format is easy to process. The files are stored in 							a so-called staging area, where they can later be further processed.
						</p>



						<p class="subtitle_dark">Transform (Data Cleansing and Harmonization)</p>

						<p class="description_dark">In the transformation phase, the data are checked, cleaned, and 								standardized.
							The goal is to obtain clean and consistent information for analysis.
						</p>

						<div class="ul-with-title">

							<p class="ul-li-title">The most important steps include:</p>					
							

							<ul>
								<li>Format adjustment: Date formats are standardized (e.g., “2025-06-10”).</li>

								<li>Error correction: Null values and duplicates are removed.</li>
								
								<li>Revenue calculation: Revenue is calculated from quantity and unit price.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>	
						<p class="description_dark">In this way, no confusion arises regarding the origin of the 								figures.</p>

					
						<p class="description_dark">For illustration purposes, a small Python script was created that 									automatically performs the cleansing. Through this simple procedure, it is 									ensured that all revenue figures are correct and traceable.			
						</p>

						

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">BI Prototype</h5>
				
						<p class="description_dark">In this chapter, I describe the practical implementation of my 								business intelligence prototype for the company Sylter Fisch. The objective was to 								demonstrate the theoretical foundations from the previous chapters especially the data 								model and the ETL process –in a functioning BI solution. I worked with Python (Pandas) 								and Power BI.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">All scripts, datasets, and screenshots are documented in my GitHub 									repository:<br>
							<a href="https://github.com/Elli55/BI-Prototyp">https://github.com/Elli55/BI-Prototyp</a>
						</p>


						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">ETL Implementation with Python</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">The initial data consisted of four CSV files: verkauf.csv, 									produkt.csv, filiale.csv and kampagne.csv.  I processed these files in Google Colab using 							Python in order to clean them, standardize them, and prepare them for Power BI.
						</p>

						<p class="ul-li-title">An example from my code:</p>

						<p class="code-text">import pandas as pd <br>
 
								verkauf = pd.read_csv("verkauf.csv") <br>
								verkauf['Datum'] = pd.to_datetime(verkauf['Datum'], format='%Y-%m-%d') <br>
								verkauf.dropna(inplace=True) <br>
								verkauf.drop_duplicates(inplace=True) <br>
								verkauf['Umsatz'] = verkauf['Menge'] * verkauf['Einzelpreis'] <br>
								verkauf['Kampagne_Flag'] = verkauf['Datum'].between('2025-06-01', '2025-06-14')									
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">With this ETL process, all data were cleaned automatically. The 								automatic revenue calculation was particularly important, as it prevents manual errors. I 							then saved the cleaned data as new files (produkte_clean, filialen_clean, 									verkauf_powerbi, Kampaniyalar_zr) and imported them into Power BI.
						</p>

					
						<p class="subtitle_dark">Relational Data Model</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The data model was built in Power BI according to the star schema 								principle, but in a compact, practice-oriented variant. At the center stands the fact 								table verkauf_powerbi, which contains all sales and discount information. Around it are 							three main dimensions as well as a supplementary campaign table in which additional DAX-							based key figures are stored.
						</p>

			
						<div class="ul-with-title">

							<p class="ul-li-title">The relationships were automatically recognized in Power BI:</p>					
							

							<ul>
								<li>produkte_clean[ProduktID] - verkauf_powerbi[ProduktID]</li>

								<li>filialen_clean[FilialID] - verkauf_powerbi[FilialID]</li>
								
								<li>Kampaniyalar_zr[ProduktID] → verkauf_powerbi[ProduktID]</li>
							</ul>
						</div>	

	
						<p class="description_dark">A separate time dimension (dim_date) was not created, since the date 							field is directly integrated into the fact table. This makes the model more compact, but 							still fully suitable for analyses by period, product, region, and campaign.
						</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Data Loading and Validation</p>
			
						<p class="description_dark">After cleansing, I loaded all four files into Power BI. The 								relationships were automatically recognized and displayed in the model view.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">For verification, I created simple DAX formulas to ensure that all 								revenue figures were transferred correctly:

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Visualization in the Power BI Dashboard</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The finished BI prototype consists of four report pages that cover 								different analysis objectives. All pages were designed according to IBCS and Hichert 								SUCCESS principles in order to visualize the information clearly and consistently.

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Result and Benefit</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The developed BI prototype for Sylter Fisch shows how operational data from 							different sources can be combined in a compact, clearly structured model. Through the combination 							of Python (for ETL) and Power BI (for visualization), a flexible system is created that:
						</p>

						<div class="ul-with-title">							

							<ul>
								<li>transparently presents sales figures,</li>

								<li>highlights regional differences,</li>

								<li>makes campaigns measurable,</li>

								<li>supports data-based decisions.</li>
								
							</ul>
						</div>	

						<p class="description_dark">The project proves that even with manageable resources, a professional, 								agile BI solution is possible a first step toward a data-driven corporate culture at Sylter Fisch.
						</p>

						
						
	
	
						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Reflection and Answer to the Assignment</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">In this case study, it was shown how a business intelligence system can be 								built for the company Sylter Fisch. The goal was to develop a solution that combines sales data from 							different sources and thus enables data-based decision-making. In the following, it is briefly 								reflected how the assignment was fulfilled and which results were achieved.
						</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Identification of the operational systems:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The three used sources (POS, ERP, and Marketing) were clearly defined and 								described. The POS data delivered the sales information, the ERP system provided the product and 								branch data, and the marketing Excel file supplied the campaigns. This established a complete 								foundation for later analysis.
						</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Data modeling:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The star schema was chosen as the logical model. It contains a fact table for 							sales data and several dimension tables (product, branch, date, campaign). This structure was 								technically implemented in Power BI and allows clear and fast evaluations.
						</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">ETL process:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The ETL process was implemented using Python (Pandas). The data were cleaned, 							standardized, and enriched with additional key figures (e.g., revenue, Kampagne_Flag). The code 								transparently shows how the data were processed and prepared for Power BI.
						</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Visualization and analysis:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The Power BI dashboard consists of four pages: KPI overview, product analysis, 							geographic analysis, and campaign analysis. Each page presents different perspectives and enables 							management decisions based on data. In particular, the comparison of branch revenues and campaign 							performance provides high added value.
						</p>

						
						<p class="subtitle_dark">Evaluation of the implementation:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">The chosen approach was deliberately pragmatic and easy to implement. Python 							and Power BI complement each other well in order to create a functioning, agile BI system. For a 								future version, the use of a SQL database as a physical foundation would be useful to design data 								storage even more professionally.
