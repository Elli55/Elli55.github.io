						<h1 class="titles_dark">Whiskey Product Portfolio Optimization Case Study</h1>

						<p class="description_dark">When I first looked at the brand's overall performance over the past 							two years, what caught my attention was the complaints around the 18YO product and a 								19% revenue decline despite significant marketing spend. My initial instinct was that 								12YO was pulling demand away from 18YO, creating a false read on where the real problem 							was. Part of why I thought that: I had already looked at competitor data and most of 								them were leaning premium. That made me think the market itself was moving in that 								direction. But the further I got into the customer data, the clearer it became the								problem wasn't 12YO. The problem was 18YO itself and how it was being positioned. 								Customers weren't turning it down because it was expensive. They just couldn't see why it 							was worth more than the 12YO sitting right next to it on the shelf. That realization 								shifted the entire direction of my analysis. And the competitive data was actually 								pointing the same way: there was a real, unfilled gap in the everyday-use segment								exactly where 12YO sat. So instead of recommending a repositioning push for 18YO, I made 							the case for simplifying the portfolio. I reallocated €1.52M in marketing budget and 								projected a €125K revenue uplift in Year 1 without increasing total spend.
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Business Context</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">This is a case study I built for my portfolio, based on a 									hypothetical premium whisky brand. The dataset was constructed using AI, designed to 								reflect realistic market dynamics drawn from publicly available industry benchmarks. The 							brand operates in the premium single malt whisky market a space where competing on price 							alone doesn't get you far. Heritage, storytelling, and how clearly a product earns its 								place on the shelf matter just as much as the price tag. And there will always be 								customers willing to pay in this category. That's exactly why sales here depend so 								heavily on perception, not just on the product itself. The portfolio runs across three 								age expressions: 12YO (€65), 18YO (€145) and 21YO (€320) each theoretically targeting a 							different type of buyer. Looking at the competitive landscape, the picture is clear: 								Glenfiddich owns mass-premium, Macallan anchors ultra-luxury, Glenlivet holds accessible 							premium. Each of them knows exactly what it is. And that clarity is precisely what makes 							the problem sitting between 12YO and 18YO so visible and so urgent.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark"> What the competitive map makes clear is that the gap between mass-								premium and ultra-luxury isn't just about price it's about perception. Brands that hold 							that space successfully don't compete on cost. They compete on narrative. Trying to write 							a new narrative for 18YO would have been, frankly, a bit of a wishful move. But 12YO 								keeps the door open. Particularly through sustained B2B partnerships bars, cocktail 								venues, on-trade channels 12YO has a real shot at becoming the lead player in this 								portfolio.

						<p class="description_dark">This analysis highlights a clear gap between mass-premium and ultra-							luxury positioning, where differentiation relies less on price and more on perceived 								expertise, storytelling, and channel strategy.
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">The Problem Statement</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">Despite significant marketing investment (€1.52M in 2024), the 								portfolio began to show structural weaknesses that negatively impacted both revenue and 							brand perception:
						</p>
						
						

						<div class="ul-with-title"><ol>
							<li><p class="description_dark ul-li-title">12YO dominance created internal 												cannibalization:</p>

    								<p class="description_dark">With 660 units sold annually and the highest value-									for-money perception, 12YO increasingly attracted customers who would otherwise 								consider 18YO, weakening the mid-tier product’s role.
								</p></li>
				
							<li ><p class="description_dark ul-li-title">18YO suffered from unclear 										positioning:</p>

								<p class="description_dark">Positioned between volume-driven 12YO and prestige-									driven 21YO, 18YO lacked a distinct identity, resulting in a 19% year-over-year 								revenue decline and growing customer perception that it was “not worth the 									premium over 12YO.”
								</p></li>

							<li><p class="description_dark ul-li-title">21YO faced pressure to justify its 										premium price:</p>

								<p class="description_dark">While maintaining strong brand prestige, declining 									volumes (-11% YoY) indicated rising expectations from status-driven buyers and 									increased sensitivity to perceived value versus ultra-luxury competitors.
								</p></li>
						</ol></div>

						</figure>

						<p class="description_dark">The competitive landscape highlights that brand naturally attracts 								connoisseurs and flavor-driven customers through its craft and story-driven positioning. 							This creates an opportunity to target customers seeking depth and authenticity rather 								than mass accessibility. At the same time, competitors such as Glenfiddich benefit from 							aggressive marketing and broad distribution, allowing them to stabilize or even grow 								sales despite market pressure. Competing directly on mass retail or aggressive marketing 							would move our brand away from its core audience.  For status-oriented buyers, clear 								ultra-premium signaling is required, as they tend to anchor their perception around 								strong, easily recognizable luxury cues.

							</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p class="description_dark">Customer segmentation reveals four clearly defined groups with 								distinct motivations and spending behavior. Connoisseurs show strong interest in 18YO, 								while Status Seekers gravitate toward 21YO and demonstrate the highest average annual 								spend. Powever, the data also indicates overlap between segments, particularly around 								premium expectations. While Connoisseurs value flavor exploration, their hesitation to 								commit to 18YO makes it difficult to fully convert interest into consistent purchases. 								Additionally, overall spending data suggests that Status Seekers spend more per location, 							which reduces the effectiveness of broad, location-based programs and increases the 								importance of precise product positioning.

						<p class="description_dark">Financial and sales performance data confirms that 18YO has 								experienced the sharpest decline across the portfolio. Despite relatively healthy 								margins, both revenue and unit sales have dropped significantly, indicating weakening 								willingness to pay rather than cost inefficiency. In contrast, 12YO remains highly 								resilient due to its strong value-for- money perception, while 21YO’s decline reflects 								rising expectations within a very specific and demanding customer group. This pattern 								supports the conclusion that 18YO’s challenges are primarily psychological and 									positional, rather than operational or market driven.

						</figure>


						<p class="description_dark">The distribution data shows that specialty stores play a 									disproportionately important role for 18YO and 21YO compared to mass retail channels. 								While retail supermarkets dominate 12YO sales, their impact on higher-age expressions is 							significantly lower. Given this structure, allocating additional resources to mass retail 							channels would not materially support premium objectives. Specialty stores are already 								aligned with the intended target audience and should remain the primary focus for premium 							portfolio execution. Other channels, such as duty-free and online partners, remain 								secondary and are currently too distant from the desired outcome to justify increased 								investment.

						<p class="description_dark">Customer pain points clearly indicate that the most critical issue 								centers around 18YO’s perceived value. The complaint “18YO not worth premium over 12YO” 							appears with high frequency and critical severity, particularly among Connoisseurs. This 							confirms that the challenge is not lack of interest, but a mismatch between price, 								expectations and communicated value. Additional concerns around brand perception and 								flavor variety further reinforce the need for clearer differentiation rather than 								increased promotional activity. These insights suggest that without addressing value 								perception, further investment in 18YO marketing would deliver diminishing returns.

						<p class="description_dark">Marketing spend analysis shows that a significant portion of 								investment is allocated to channels that primarily support 12YO volume rather than 								premium value creation. By discontinuing 18YO-focused campaigns, a substantial budget 								becomes available for reallocation. Redirecting part of this budget toward strengthening 							brand perception and premium signaling creates an opportunity to reinforce both 12YO and 							21YO without increasing total spend. In particular, reallocating funds from generic 								digital advertising toward more targeted channels improves alignment with premium 								objectives. Overall, this creates approximately €1.52M in available marketing capacity 								that can be used more strategically.

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Proposed Marketing Reallocation</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">With 18YO marketing discontinued, approximately €1.52M becomes 								available for reallocation. Rather than increasing total spend, this budget will be 								redistributed to better support our simplified two-product portfolio.

							<figcaption class="description-text">Fig. 7: Product attribute scores by age expression 								perceived value, complexity, smoothness and brand aura rated against competitor 								average.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>


						<p class="description_dark">Product attribute scores reveal a clear imbalance in perceived value. 							While 18YO performs well on complexity and smoothness, its value-for-money score is 								significantly lower than both 12YO and the competitor average. This gap explains 								recurring customer dissatisfaction and reinforces price resistance. Without visual, 								experiential, or narrative upgrades, 18YO will continue to trigger friction at the point 							of purchase. Conversely, improving brand aura and visual perception around 12YO offers an 							opportunity to elevate perceived value without changing price.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Across all datasets, the evidence consistently points to a portfolio 							design issue rather than a demand shortage. The core challenge lies in how value is 								communicated and perceived across age expressions, with 18YO positioned in a way that 								creates friction instead of progression.
						</p>


						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Strategic Options:</h5>
						<br><br>

						<p class="titles_dark">Option 1: Aggressive Premium Repositioning of 18YO</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Strategy:</p>
					
						<p class="description-text">Reposition 18YO as a clearly premium product by increasing its price 							and limiting availability, aiming to close the perceived gap with 21YO.
						</p>
						

						

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Key Actions:</p>
				
						<ul>
							<li>Increase 18YO retail price to reinforce premium perception.</li>

							<li>Restrict distribution primarily to specialty stores.</li>

							<li>Shift messaging toward exclusivity and craftsmanship.</li>

							<li>Reduce mass-market visibility to avoid comparison with 12YO.</li>
						</ul></div>


						
						
						<p class="subtitle_dark">Expected Outcome: </p>
					
						<p class="description_dark">This approach could improve perceived value and margins if 									accepted by Connoisseurs, but carries a high risk of volume loss due to existins 								price sensitivity and weak value-for-money perception.
						</p>

		
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Risks:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Strong resistance from customers already questioning 18YO value.</li>

							<li>High probability of accelerated sales decline.</li>

							<li>Increased internal competition with 21YO.</li>
						</ul></div>



						<p class="titles_dark">Option 2: Portfolio Clarification by Phasing Out 18YO 											(Preferred)</p>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Strategy:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Remove 18YO from the active portfolio and simplify the value ladder 							by focusing on a clear two-step progression: 12YO for quality-driven volume and 21YO for 							status-driven premium demand.</p>

						
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Key Actions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Discontinue 18YO-focused marketing activities.</li>
	
							<li>Redirect freed marketing budget toward brand strengthening initiatives.</li>
	
							<li>Enhance visual identity and perceived value of 12YO.</li>
	
							<li>Reinforce ultra-premium signaling for 21YO through selective channels.</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Expected Outcome:</p>
				
						<p class="description_dark">By eliminating internal cannibalization and psychological friction, 							the portfolio becomes easier to understand. This strengthens trade-up logic toward 21YO 							while preserving 12YO’s strong volume base.
						</p>


						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Why This Option:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Directly addresses the most critical customer pain point.</li>
	
							<li>Frees approximately €1.52M in marketing capacity without increasing spend.</li>

							<li>Aligns with observed customer behavior and spending patterns.</li>

							<li>Reduces complexity and execution risk.</li>
						</ul></div>



						<p class="titles_dark">Option 3: Volume-First Strategy Focused on 12YO (Not Recommended)</p>

						<p class="subtitle_dark">Strategy:</p>
					
						<p class="description_dark">Double down on 12YO as the primary growth driver by prioritizing 								volume and mass appeal while deprioritizing premium positioning.</p>



						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Key Actions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Allocate the majority of marketing spend to 12YO.</li>
	
							<li>Expand mass retail and promotional activities.</li>

							<li>Minimize focus on premium differentiation.</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Expected Outcome:</p>
						
						<p class="description_dark">Short-term sales stability driven by volume growth, but at the cost 							of long-term brand equity and premium perception.</p>

	

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Risks:</p>
		
						<ul>
							<li>Brand dilution and loss of premium identity.</li>
			
							<li>Reduced attractiveness for high-value customers.</li>
				
							<li>Increased price sensitivity across the portfolio.</li>
						</ul></div>

						<p class="description_dark">Given the structural nature of the problem and the risks associated 							with forcing premium repositioning, simplifying the portfolio emerged as the most 								sustainable and least risky strategic direction.
						</p>
						
						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Risk Analysis</h5>


						<p class="description_dark">While Option 2 offers the clearest path forward, it carries 									meaningful risks that require active management. Removing 18YO eliminates €15,950 								in annual revenue. Not all of this revenue will automatically transfer to other 							products.</p>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Downside Scenario:</p>
					

					
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">If customer behavior does not follow expectations, the following 								outcomes are possible:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>50% of current 18YO buyers move down to 12YO (55 customers)<br>
								Revenue gain: 55 × €65 = €3,575
							</li>

							<li>20% trade up to 21YO (22 customers)<br>
								Revenue gain: 22 × €320 = €7,040
							</li>

							<li>30% leave for competitors such as Glenfiddich or Macallan (33 customers)<br>
								Revenue lost: 33 × €145 = €4,785
							</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Net Impact:-€5,335 (-8% of total portfolio revenue)
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">This scenario becomes more likely if customers are not actively 								guided through the transition. To reduce this risk, a 90-day customer retention program 							will start in Month 1, including direct outreach to former 18YO	buyers and targeted 								incentives to encourage trial of 21YO. Removing 18YO creates a gap in the €145–200 price 							range, which competitors may see as an opportunity.
						</p>

					
						<p class="subtitle_dark">Likely Scenarios:</p>

						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Scenario 1:</p>
						
						<p class="description_dark">Glenfiddich reduces the price of their 18YO from €175 to €135. 								Position 12YO as better value ("Why pay €135 for 18 years when you can get quality at 								€65?") and accelerate brand elevation work to strengthen 12YO perception.
						</p>


						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Scenario 2:</p>
					
						<p class="description_dark">Macallan launches a new mid-tier product priced around €160. Double 							down on 21YO exclusivity and heritage positioning, where Macallan cannot fully match our 							craft story. Competitor pricing and product launches will be monitored monthly 									during the first six months, with flexibility to adjust strategy if market conditions 								change significantly.
						</p>


						<p class="description_dark"><strong>Retailer Relationship Risk</strong></p>

						<p class="description_dark">Specialty retailers currently generate revenue from three Balvenie 								products. Reducing the portfolio to two SKUs may reduce shelf presence and total sales 								for these partners.
						</p>

	
						<p class="subtitle_dark">Retailer Concern:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">"If Balvenie reduces my revenue, why should I give you premium shelf 							space?"</p>


						
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">To address this, a three-part specialty store partnership program 								will launch in Month 1:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Margin improvement — Increase 21YO retailer margin from 25% to 30%.<br>
								Cost: €512 per year, securing long-term relationships.
							</li>

							<li>Co-funded displays — €2,000 per store for premium in-store setups.<br>
								Total investment: €40K across 20 key locations.
							</li>
						
							<li>Staff training & events — Product education sessions and customer tasting events.<br>
								Total investment: €65K.
							</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="description_dark">This approach keeps retailers engaged and motivated to promote the 								remaining portfolio despite a reduced SKU count.
						</p>



						<p class="subtitle_dark">Customer Confusion Risk:</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Some customers who actively searched for 18YO may feel confused or 								frustrated when it is no longer available.
						</p>

						

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">To manage the transition smoothly, the following steps will be 									taken:</p>


						<ul>
							<li>Month 1 — Inform specialty retailers first and provide clear talking points for 									staff.
							</li>

							<li>Month 2 — Email past 18YO buyers with a personal explanation and a one-time 15% 									discount on 21YO.
							</li>

							<li>Month 3–6 — Monitor customer service inquiries and retailer feedback on a weekly 									basis.
							</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="description_dark">If confusion or negative sentiment exceeds 20% of feedback, 								additional communication materials will be created or a limited farewell edition will be 							considered to ease the transition. These risks are real but manageable. Success depends 							on staying close to the data during the first six months and responding quickly if 								customer behavior deviates from projections.
						</p>

						<h5 class="subtitle_dark">Recomendation</h5>

						<p class="description_dark">Based on the analysis, I recommend phasing out 18YO from active 								portfolio focus and simplifying the value ladder around two clearly differentiated 								products: 12YO as the quality-driven volume anchor and 21YO as the status-driven premium 							expression. This approach directly addresses the root causes identified in customer 								pains, financial performance, and marketing efficiency, while minimizing execution risk 							and preserving long-term brand equity.
						</p>


						
						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">This recommendation was selected because it:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Eliminates internal cannibalization between 12YO and 18YO.</li>
	
							<li>Removes the most critical customer pain point around value perception.</li>

							<li>Frees marketing capacity without increasing total spend.</li>
	
							<li>Strengthens portfolio clarity and trade-up logic.</li>
	
							<li>Aligns with observed customer behavior rather than forcing repositioning.</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="description_dark">Implementation will follow a phased and controlled approach:</p>

						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Phase 1:  Portfolio Reset (Months 1–2)</p>

						<p class="description_dark">18YO-related marketing activities are discontinued. Existing 								inventory is managed through natural sell-through without promotional pressure.

						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Phase 2:  Brand Reinforcement (Months 3–6)</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Freed marketing budget is redirected toward strengthening brand aura 							and visual perception, with a focus on modernizing 12YO communication and reinforcing 								premium cues around 21YO.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark ul-li-title">Phase 3: Premium Focus Optimization (Months 6–12)</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Selective channels such as specialty stores, trade shows, and 								targeted digital placements are used to support 21YO visibility and reinforce status-								driven demand.
						</p>

						

						<div class="ul-with-title">
							<p class="ul-li-title">Success will be evaluated using the following metrics:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Stabilization of total portfolio revenue year-over-year.</li>

							<li>Reduction in customer complaints related to value perception.</li>
			
							<li>Improved marketing efficiency measured by ROI per channel.</li>

							<li>Increased share of premium sales driven by 21YO.</li>
	
							<li>Clearer product understanding reported by specialty retailers.</li>
						</ul></div>


						<p class="subtitle_dark">Success Metrics</p>
	
						<p class="description_dark">Performance will be tracked across three levels: primary business 								outcomes, leading indicators and risk monitoring.
						</p>

						<p class="description_dark">Primary Metrics (Business Impact):</p>

						<p class="ul-li-title">Total portfolio revenue: Maintain ≥ €69M per year.</p>

						<p class="description_dark">This case demonstrates how portfolio performance issues can stem not 							from market demand, but from internal complexity and unclear value communication. By 								prioritizing clarity over expansion, the strategy focuses on sustainable growth rather 								than short-term optimization.
