						<h5 class="subtitle">Personal Finance and Productivity Management App (Desktop: Windows)</h5>

						<p class="description-text">Dəli Kimii APP is a desktop program created for personal use, later 							improved and shared as open source. Its goal is simple: to see your financial situation 							and activity progress in one place, in an easy and visual way, for a set period of time.

It also 									automatically manages categories for easier organization. The app provides visual 								analysis with graphs and charts using Matplotlib, lets you track your progress 									over a chosen time period, and supports saving and loading data from CSV files as 								well as exporting reports to Word.

						<h3 class="titles">Career Coaching & High Profiling® Program – INQUA Institute	</h3>

						<p class="description-text"> This is a structured career coaching program provided by the INQUA 								Institute in Germany. The program is based on an individual and systemic approach 								and focuses on career positioning, long-term goal setting, and strategic 									planning. It also includes practical and interesting elements such as personal 									analysis and the exploration of one’s professional role and behavior.
						</p>

						<p class="description-text">I completed the program in a hybrid format over a period of 8 weeks. 								The first sessions were mainly focused on personal analysis, and this part was 									especially valuable for me. We looked at strengths and weaknesses from an 									analytical perspective, not an emotional one. Based on these insights, we worked 								on building a personal and realistic strategic approach.
						</p>

								<p class="description-text">In the later sessions, the focus shifted more toward 									decision-making based on environment and situations. We worked on 										identifying internal and external factors that shape our professional and 									personal positions. Special attention was given to understanding these 										influences clearly and not ignoring them when making decisions.
								</p>

								<p class="description-text"> Overall, the program was rich and well balanced. The 									topics were not only about career or job searching. They were more 										focused on self-understanding, attitude toward work and responsibility, 									motivation, and behavior patterns. Through this process, I learned 										analysis and thinking methods that are not limited only to the work 										environment.

						<h3 class="titles">Communication Power Program — Julia Rupprecht</h3>

						<p class="description-text">This two-day Communication Power program was organized by the Career 							Center of Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University, and the training was conducted by Julia 								Rupprecht, a communication and rhetoric coach in Germany. Julia has academic education in 							"Speech Communication and Rhetoric" and also has practical experience in the field of 								speech and language, and her main focus is directed towards helping people express their 							thoughts in a clearer, more effective and convincing way.
						</p>

						<section class="choised-content-grid-right">

							<div>
								<img class="foto-for-grid-contents" src="Fotos/Projects/power.png">
							</div>

							<div>
								<p class="description-text">The goal here is not just to choose words correctly, 									but to understand how a person is perceived through their voice, body 										language and behavior style. During the training, practical answers were 									sought to questions like why sometimes even correct ideas don't reach the 									other side in the communication process, why some people automatically 										attract attention when speaking, while others remain invisible even 										though they give the same message.
								</p>
							</div>
						</section>

						<p class="description-text"> During the program, the basic principles of rhetoric, building 								arguments and situation-appropriate communication strategies were worked on through real 							dialogues. Through various workshops and practical tasks, participants learned how 								manipulation techniques work, how to recognize such approaches and how to react against 							them. The especially emphasized point was that during communication, not only what to 								say, but when and in what form to say it is more effective.	
						</p>
		
						<p class="description-text">The strongest side of this program is that theoretical knowledge was 							analyzed not in an abstract form, but on real situations that we can face in daily life, 							academic and professional environments. Thanks to role plays, mutual feedback and 								observations, the psychological side of the communication process started to become 								clearer. At the end of the two days, significant progress was felt not only on speaking 							techniques, but also on self-confidence, observation ability and conscious reaction 								skills.
						</p>

						<p class="description-text"> Julia's teaching style was open, sincere and at the same time 								structured. No mandatory "rhetoric rules" were memorized; on the contrary, the aim was to 							make each participant's own natural communication style stronger and more effective. In 							this respect, the Communication Power program remained in memory as a practical 								experience that brings communication skills to a more conscious and effective level in a 							short time.

						<h3 class="titles">Winter Leadership School – (2018)</h3>

						<p class="description-text">This one-week leadership program was organized by the Azerbaijan 								Students Youth Organizations’ Union in cooperation with the Ministry of Youth and Sports 							of Azerbaijan and brought together students from different regions and educational 								backgrounds. The program focused on leadership, teamwork, communication, and social 								engagement through a combination of trainings, workshops, and group-based activities.
						</p>
						
						<section class="choised-content-grid-left">

							<div>
								<p class="description-text"> Throughout the program, the emphasis was not placed 									on theoretical leadership models, but on practical interaction, 										collaboration, and responsibility within a group. Working in teams, 										exchanging perspectives, and dealing with real-life tasks made the 										learning process dynamic and experience-based rather than abstract.
								</p>
									
								<p class="description-text"> One of the most valuable aspects of this program was 									the opportunity to observe different communication and leadership styles 									in a diverse group setting. It helped me better understand how group 										dynamics work, how roles naturally form in teams and how personal 										attitude and behavior influence collective outcomes. Overall, the Winter 									Leadership School remained a formative educational and social experience 									that contributed to my personal development and my understanding of 										collaborative work.

						<h3 class="titles"> Savings Game – German Savings Banks Foundation</h3>

						<p class="description-text"> This program was organized by the German Savings Banks Foundation 								for International Cooperation and focused on long-term financial thinking and responsible 							decision-making. The “Savings Game” was designed as an interactive learning format that 							combined financial topics with simulations, group discussions, and practical tasks.

								<p class="description-text">During the program, the main focus was on long-term 									financial planning, understanding risks, and evaluating financial 										decisions over time. Instead of only learning theory, participants worked 									on realistic scenarios that showed how everyday financial choices can 										influence future stability and sustainability. Topics such as saving, 										investment thinking, and financial responsibility were discussed in a 										clear and practical way.
								</p>

								<p class="description-text"> A strong part of this program was its interactive 										structure. Through teamwork and active participation, it became easier to 									understand how financial decisions are connected to behavior, planning 									        and personal responsibility. Overall, the Savings Game helped me develop 									a more conscious and structured approach to long-term financial decisions 									and increased my awareness of how financial thinking affects both 										personal and professional life.

						<h3 class="titles">Ac Oldun? / Food-Delivery</h3>

						<p class="description-text">
							Ac Oldun was my first serious and real commercial project. The idea did not start from 								technology, but from a simple daily problem: office food fills your stomach, but it does 							not feel like home. Many offices had catering services, but they were missing the taste 							and warmth of home-cooked food.
						</p>

						<img class="foto-center" src="Fotos/Projects/acoldun.png">

						<p class="description-text">
							I built the idea around this problem not just delivering food to offices, but 								delivering the feeling of home. In the first stage, everything was very simple. The food 							was cooked at home, the number of clients was small, and most processes were done 								manually. This stage helped me understand one important thing: the problem was real, and 							people truly cared about it.
						</p>

							</div>

							<div>
								<p class="description-text">
								With this concept, I joined the IdeyaQazandı 2018 national entrepreneurship 									competition and reached the final stage. I presented the idea on stage, answered 								many questions,	and explained it as a real business. Reaching the final was a big 								motivation for me, but honestly, I did not receive investment. My stage 									presentation from IdeyaQazandı can be seen here:<a 												href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2136795326337478&rdid=JmoFWiUVxwE2vT5J" 								target="_blank">www.facebook.com/watch</a>
								</p>
		
							<p class="description-text">
								At first, this moment felt like a failure, but it became a strong learning 									experience. I understood that having a good idea is not enough. Execution, cost 								planning and clear explanation of risks are just as important.
							</p>
							</div>		
						</section>

						<p class="description-text">	
							After some time, I found an alternative investor and relaunched Ac Oldun with a more 								realistic approach. At this stage, the project was no longer romantic. It was about 								operations, logistics, customer expectations, costs, and daily decisions. The project 								became fully functional and achieved successful results in practice. For me, Ac Oldun was 							not just a startup. It was my first real school as a founder. I learned about product–								market fit, responsibility and the real results of wrong decisions. This experience 								strongly shaped how I think and work in later projects.
